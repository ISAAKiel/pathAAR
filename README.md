# pathAAR
R Package to reconstruct paths using archaeological monuments, model parameters of infrastructure and evaluate those parameters

Archaeological remains of roads or infrastructure are rarley found, especially in earlier epochs. Usually, most premodern paths have been country lanes, which might be paved when needed. Hence, their preservation is linked to specific conditions, like waterlocked environements. Solidly constrcuted roads, as the Roman Empire erected across europe, are exeptionally in their preservation, construction, purpose and planing. 
But, monuments situated next to a paths - landmarks - are more likely to be preserved and recovered. Those landmarks can be medieval border stones, premodern burial mounds or neolithic gallery graves. The choose of a path associated feature depends on region, culture and epoch. 

`pathAAR` is designed to reconstruct paths next to the location of so called path associated features using a Kernel Density Approach.  

Additionally, using `pathAAR` enables you to modell certain parameters likely to be influencial for systems of infrastructure. Wheter a pedestrian walk, the use of a vehicule, avoding certain areas or prefering others influenced the location of a path can be modelled, tested and evaluated. Selecting and defining parameters needs to be done by the user, depending on region, culture and epoch!
